I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist working on strongly correlated quantum many-body systems and topological phases of matter.

My research focuses on:

- **Moiré materials and 2D heterostructures**, including rhombohedral graphene multilayers and twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides.
- **Fractional quantum Hall states**, with a particular emphasis on graphene-based quantum Hall platforms.
- **Unconventional superconductivity**, such as fluctuation-mediated pairing and anyon superconductivity.
- **Quantum criticality**, including continuous transitions out of topological phases and applications of the fuzzy-sphere.

I work closely with experimental groups, combining microscopic modeling, field theory, and large-scale numerical simulations (DMRG and tensor networks) to compare theory with experiment at a quantitative level.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University (HQI Prize Fellow, Simons UQM) and a joint postdoctoral fellow at MIT, working with Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf, and Patrick A. Lee.
