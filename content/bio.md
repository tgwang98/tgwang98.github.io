I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist working on strongly correlated quantum many-body systems and topological phases of matter.

My research focuses on:
- **Moiré materials and 2D heterostructures**, including rhombohedral graphene multilayers, twisted MoTe₂/WSe₂, and graphene quantum Hall platforms.
- **Fractional quantum Hall and fractional Chern insulators**, especially interaction-driven topological order, anyon condensation, and non-Abelian phases.
- **Unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality**, such as fluctuation-mediated pairing and continuous transitions out of topological phases.

I work closely with experimental groups using microscopic modeling, field theory, and large-scale numerics (DMRG, tensor networks) to confront theory with data at a quantitative level.
Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University (HQI Prize Fellow, Simons UQM) and a joint postdoctoral fellow at MIT, working with Ashvin Vishwanath, Eslam Khalaf, and Patrick A. Lee.
