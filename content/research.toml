My long-term goal is to use moiré and other 2D platforms as a controllable laboratory for truly exotic quantum phases including topological order and unconventional superconductors, and to understand not only each phase, but the web of phase transitions that connect them.

Moiré systems are *highly tunable* in a way that is rare in traditional condensed-matter materials. By changing density, displacement field, twist angle, or magnetic field, the same device can realize very different phases: in graphene multilayers and twisted TMDs one can see quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states, fractional QAH (FQAH) states, and superconductivity in a single device. This tunability makes it possible to build microscopic models that can be quantitatively confronted with experiment, rather than just qualitatively compared.

The first step in organizing this landscape is to understand the “parent” states from which these exotic phases descend. Because these systems carry spin and valley degrees of freedom, the parent phases are often various forms of magnetic or isospin order. Different patterns may or may not break time-reversal symmetry, and therefore carry a net Berry curvature. In rhombohedral graphene and twisted TMDs, we mapped out the first magnetic phase diagrams with realistic models and identified the competition between different orders. QAH then naturally appears in orders that produce Chern bands.

The second step is to ask how far this logic extends beyond moiré superlattices. In pentalayer graphene, we discovered a new **anomalous Hall crystal** (AHC) phase: a Wigner crystal that nevertheless carries a Hall response. Here interactions spontaneously open a transport gap *without* relying on a moiré potential. In the presence of disorder this state behaves as a QAH insulator.

Importantly, these 2D materials mark the first examples a QAH state is realized in an isolated Chern band. By fractionally doping these Chern bands, one obtains the long sought fractional QAH states (FQAH). Experiments by Long Ju, Xiaodong Xu and collaborators confirm this picture, and we provided quantitative microscopic calculations that match the observed phases.

The more intriguing descendant phases for me are the superconductors. Many of these 2D systems exhibit superconductivity, but in different parameter windows and with different properties, suggesting potentially different mechanisms. We have proposed three broad mechanisms:

1. **Isospin-fluctuation-mediated pairing.** In bilayer and trilayer graphene, superconductivity tends to appear near the boundaries between competing magnetic phases, where isospin fluctuations are strongest. We analyzed how strong these fluctuations are and what pairing symmetries they naturally favor.

2. **Charge-density-fluctuation-mediated pairing.** In pentalayer graphene, superconductivity appears close to the AHC phase. The phonons of an electron crystal play a role analogous to lattice phonons and can mediate superconductivity even in higher-angular-momentum pairing channels.

3. **Anyon superconductivity.** This is the most exotic mechanism. In twisted TMDs, superconductivity often appears very close to FQAH states and nearby re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases. Using field theory, we showed that superconductivity and RIQH are the natural descendants of a FQAH state, whereas a simple metallic phase is not. Numerical work supports this picture and provides an example of superconductivity induced by purely repulsive interactions.

Taken together, moiré and 2D materials provide a uniquely versatile setting in which one can realize QAH, FQAH, electron crystals, and several distinct routes to superconductivity. This makes it possible not only to study each phase in isolation, but to track *continuous transitions* between them and to ask which phases are the true “parent” states from which the others emerge.

My interest in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is strongly driven by experiment. I think of FQHE as a concrete platform where we can design and test microscopic ideas about topological order. Two long-term goals guide most of my work in this area:

1. To build a robust platform for **topological quantum computation** based on non Abelian anyons  
2. To discover and understand **new topological phases of matter** that go beyond our standard paradigms

There are many proposals for topological quantum computation based on nanowires, proximitized superconductors and related systems. The platform I find most compelling is non Abelian states in the FQHE. The samples can be extremely clean, the anyons can be manipulated with gates and interferometry, and some non Abelian states are powerful enough in principle to support universal quantum computation.

In bilayer graphene, Pfaffian like states at even-denominator fillings are particularly promising. Together with collaborators, we have outlined a protocol for how such a state could be used for topological quantum computation, from initializing topological degrees of freedom to implementing controlled braiding operations and reading out the result.

Several key steps have already been demonstrated in experiment, including new device architectures and lithography, tunneling and STM probes that access fractional edge structure, interferometry that reveals fractional statistics, and thermodynamic measurements that are sensitive to the entropy of non Abelian anyons.

A second thread in my FQHE work focuses on new topological phases that naturally emerge in graphene based quantum Hall systems. Graphene allows multilayer structures and additional valley degrees of freedom. This opens the door to topological orders that do not appear in single layer GaAs, to unconventional phase transitions between them, and to regimes where topological order coexists with symmetry breaking states.

Within this broader context, we introduced the notion of an **anyon superfluid**. In the bilayer and trilayer settings we studied, there is no simple boson that condenses in the usual way. Instead, one can think in terms of partons forming their own quantum Hall states, and the resulting low energy theory describes a superfluid that retains an underlying topological order. This revives the old idea of anyon superconductivity in a concrete and controlled setting.

For me, FQHE in graphene and related platforms is therefore both a playground for topological quantum computation and a laboratory for discovering new forms of topological order and their unusual descendants, such as anyon superfluids and daughter states.
